abstract: Explaining the maintenance of diverse species assemblages is a central goal
  of ecology and conservation. Recent coexistence mechanisms highlight the role of
  dispersal as a source of the differences that allow similar species to coexist.
  Here, we propose a new mechanism for species coexistence that is based on dispersal
  differences, and on the geometry of the habitat patch. In a finite habitat patch
  with complex boundaries, species with different dispersal abilities will arrange
  themselves in stable, concentric patterns of dominance. Species with superior competitive
  and dispersal abilities will dominate the interior of the patch, with inferior species
  at the periphery. We demonstrate and explain the mechanism on a simple one-dimensional
  domain, and then on two-dimensional habitat patches with realistic geometries. Finally,
  we use metrics from landscape ecology to demonstrate that habitat patches with more
  complex geometries can more easily support coexistence. The factors that underpin
  this new coexistence mechanism— different dispersal abilities and habitat patches
  with complex geometries— are common to many marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and
  it is therefore possible that the mechanism is a common factor supporting diverse
  species assemblages.
