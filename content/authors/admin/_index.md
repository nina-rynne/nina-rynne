# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include climate change modelling and impact assessment, focusing on the short-term impacts of peak temperature on ecosystems and human wellbeing. I am also a keen reader of sci-fi, history and natural sciences. All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start from a position of thinking itâ€™s pretty damn complicated in the first place. - Douglas Adams
